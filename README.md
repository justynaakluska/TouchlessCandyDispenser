With this color-sorting candy dispenser I managed to install several different devices according to the
proper IT process of designing, implementing, and testing. Once all the devices were installed and running
correctly the original, self-developed C + + code was uploaded to an Arduino MEGA 2560 microcontroller.
Finally, the dispenser managed to successfully be activated via a VL53L1X Time-of-Flight Distance Sensor,
moving candy using a Servo Micro Motor, detecting colors using a TCS3200 Color Sensor, and sorting them
correctly by the use of a second Servo Micro Motor. Additionally, WS2811 LED strips were installed as a
visual feature.
